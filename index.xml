      <description>Keeping your Prometheus optimized can be a tedious task over time, but it&amp;rsquo;s essential in order to maintain the stability of it and also to keep the cardinality under control.
Identifying the unnecessary metrics at source, deleting the existing unneeded metrics from your TSDB regularly will keep your Prometheus storage &amp;amp; performance intact.
In this article we’ll look at both identifying, dropping them at source and deleting the already stored metrics from Prometheus.</description>

      <title>How to configure Readiness Probe alert in Prometheus</title>
      <link>https://tanmay-bhat.github.io/posts/configure-readiness-probe-alert-prometheus/</link>

      <guid>https://tanmay-bhat.github.io/posts/configure-readiness-probe-alert-prometheus/</guid>
      <description>This article aims to explain the steps to configure Readiness Probe failure alert in Prometheus.
Definition : Readiness Probe in Kubernetes is a probing mechanism to detect health (ready status) of a pod and if the health is intact, then allow the traffic to the pod.
From the official doc,
 Sometimes, applications are temporarily unable to serve traffic. For example, an application might need to load large data or configuration files during startup, or depend on external services after startup.</description>

      <description>Who will monitor the monitoring system ? Itself&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;sounds a bit magical.
Since Prometheus monitors everything, it&amp;rsquo;s essential that we keep an eye on Prometheus so that over observability pillar stays strong.
If Prometheus goes down, you won&amp;rsquo;t be having any metrics, hence no alert for any services, scary stuff along with a call from your boss !!
Configuring Prometheus to monitor itself Prometheus exposes metrics about itself at /metrics endpoint, hence it can scrape and monitor its own health.</description>

      <description>Push vs Pull Prometheus is by far the best OSS you can get in 2022 for self-hosted / SaaS monitoring.
There are other solutions that grew out of Prometheus for ex Thanos or Cortex.
I believe the reason for this is the simplicity that Prometheus offers for querying the metrics and the way it handles millions of time series.
Before we jump into the implementation, let’s learn a bit about Prometheus Pull based mechanism for monitoring.</description>

      <description>What&amp;rsquo;s Apps of Apps or Cluster bootstrapping ?  The App of Apps Pattern helps us define a root Application. So, rather than point to an application manifest fort every application creation, the Root App points to a folder which contains the Application YAML definition for each child App. Each child app’s Application YAML then points to a directory containing the actual application manifests be it in manifest file, Helm or Kustomize.</description>

      <description>You heard it right, everyone needs to rest once a while, even our little Kubernetes cluster. Before we begin, here are the prerequisites :
 Kubernetes cluster Cluster autoscaler Bit of patience  Usecase :  One of the most important aspect when it comes to running workload in cloud is to keep cost under control or tune it such that you can save extra. You maybe hosting workload in Kubernetes where you wont get traffic post business hours.</description>

      <description>One Loadbalancer to rule them all ? you heard it true, Its achievable !
For AWS LoadBalancer Controller Until couple weeks ago, we were creating a loadbalancer for each namespace ( by default from AWS), which was a waste of resources and money. Hence we thought how can we use a **single loadbalancer ** across all the namespaces.
Here&amp;rsquo;s an example of before migration, how ingress looked like for default namespace:</description>

      <title>Hosting the Chartmuseum in DigitalOcean Spaces</title>
      <link>https://tanmay-bhat.github.io/posts/2021-12-12-hosting-the-chartmuseum-in-digital-ocean-space/</link>

      <guid>https://tanmay-bhat.github.io/posts/2021-12-12-hosting-the-chartmuseum-in-digital-ocean-space/</guid>
      <description>Most DevOps engineers who use Chartmuseum to store/host their helm charts use S3 as their storage medium. Well, I wanted to try Digital Ocean spaces as its S3 compatible storage option.
Well, there&amp;rsquo;s an obvious reason why to use S3 in the first place. Beautiful integration with AWS other services, cheap, easy to access, versioning, MFA delete protection etc.
However, if you&amp;rsquo;re an early developer / DevOps engineer or in a small startup who doesn&amp;rsquo;t wanna go through 1000 configurations in AWS just to create one single storage bucket in the cloud and again go through 1000 more security hurdles in case you want this bucket to be public, you should use DO Spaces.</description>

      <description>Introduction Though this seems like an easy straight forward task by referring to the docs, it&amp;rsquo;s not trust me!
Until today in my Gitlab CI, I used to use aws-cli image and later install amazon-linux extras install docker and then use DIND service to build docker images through Gitlab-CI. that will change from today.
I learned about the tool called Kaniko from Google which is built to simplify the docker build process without using Docker daemon hence not giving root-level privileges to the runner hence security says top-notch during the build process.</description>

      <description>This happened 3 days ago. I received a message from one of our ML engineers that he can&amp;rsquo;t access the EC2 server in the us-east-1 region. I asked him about the error message and he said ssh is giving a time-out error.
So, I tried connecting to the server via EC2 connect feature (web shell) that AWS provides, and even that said connection timed out.
Tried telnet to the endpoint and was the same also.</description>

      <description>Hey all! It&amp;rsquo;s been a long time since I haven&amp;rsquo;t written a blog about Kubernetes. So I was wandering in r/devops in Reddit and saw a post where the digital ocean is hosting a Kubernetes challenge and guess what they&amp;rsquo;re giving away free credits of $120 to try it out free!!!
This blog is written in multiple sections from steps to apply to steps to deploy your app in Digital Ocean Kubernetes via CI/CD.</description>

      <description>History You may have faced this scenario where you wanna keep scaling up apps nodes but also under-keeping costs at a limit. Spot Instance is the way for that task. Now, how do we do that? let&amp;rsquo;s see.
As you know there are mainly 2 types of instances in AWS, called On-demand and Spot. As the name suggests On-demand is priced highest because it&amp;rsquo;s literally on demand from your side to AWS about node requirement.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re wondering why do I write about AWS that much, that&amp;rsquo;s because AWS is the cloud on which I spend most of my work hours in Skit.ai as a DevOps Engineer.
Ok, let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at what cluster autoscaler is and how does it work?
Definition Cluster Autoscaler is a tool that automatically adjusts the size of the Kubernetes cluster when one of the following conditions is true:</description>

      <description>Definition Let&amp;rsquo;s Understand what&amp;rsquo;s volume resizing mean for Persistent Volumes kin KUbernetes.
Its the ability to dynamically increase the PV size as required ( EBS volume behind the scene ).
Problem statement Up until v1.16 EKS, you can just increase any ( PV ) EBS volume size just by running command like : kubectl edit pv your_PV and just change the size, it used to work since you have storage class of kubernetes.</description>

      <description>Previously I have written https://wp.me/pcknFJ-2F&amp;quot;&amp;gt;article about how AWS pushed broken image to Docker hub and we got screwed as we were using latest as image tag.
Welp, this happened again in our CI/CD pipeline as we were using https://github.com/chartmuseum/helm-push&amp;quot;&amp;gt;push plugin from helm and using that to push charts to https://chartmuseum.com/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;chartmuseum .
So we were using the below line to pull the helm push plugin :
helm plugin install https://github.com/chartmuseum/helm-push.git And were pushing to Chartmuseum via command :</description>

      <description>Question After reading the above title you maybe thinking why though? moving the complete worker node fleet into single Availability Zone (AZ) is not a good solution when it comes to high availability of your Kubernetes cluster workload.
There&amp;rsquo;s a reason at least why I had this requirement, Cost optimization in AWS.
Background When you create a EKS cluster, it&amp;rsquo;ll have 3 subnets each correcting to a single AZ i.e 3 AZ in a region.</description>

      <description>History If you&amp;rsquo;re using aws-cli docker image in your CI pipeline then this story could be useful amusing for you.
On Thursday, I started receiving alerts that our CI pipeline is failing.
I started checking the failed job error and it pointed out to docker is unable to install killing the pipeline.
Installing docker Installation failed. Check that you have permissions to install. Cleaning up file based variables ERROR: Job failed: command terminated with exit code 1 After scratching the head for sometime, I found that the latest aws-cli image from amazon Docker hub repository is causing the issue as I haven&amp;rsquo;t changed anything else in the CI file in few weeks.</description>

      <description>Even though the **netstat **tool is depreciated, sometimes we can&amp;rsquo;t stop the old habit and we arrive at a situation where its difficult to adapt to new things.
Actually we should be using **ss **tool installed of netstat !
All common network related tools are bundled with package net-tools.
nwlab:/etc # rpm -qa | grep net-tools net-tools-2.0+git20170221.479bb4a-lp152.5.5.x86_64 However in openSUSE 15, the team decided to knock it off from net tools package!</description>
