Ok, to be honest, I searched a lot on the internet to change ISP DNS servers to 3rd party servers (which you should !) for my router and couldn't find a direct article / steps to do that. Hence, this article.   
  
  
## Steps
  
  
- Open the router login page, which is mostly : [192.168.1.1](http://192.168.1.1) in your case.
- After logging in, navigate to Network page, Â LAN IP Address tab.</li>
- Change the *Lan Dns Mode* to : **static**</li>
- Set the primary and secondary DNS address and click on Save/Apply.</li>
- Perform a reboot of router to apply the changes.</li>

  There are a lot of DNS providers out there most of them for free. However, please be wise while choosing them.   
  
  
  I have chosen <span style="text-decoration:underline;">1.1.1.1 </span>DNS as my primary server which is provided by Cloudflare.   
  
  
  I have set the secondary  server to <span style="text-decoration:underline;">8.8.8.8 </span> which is provided by Google so that if one of the service is down, it will fallback to another.
