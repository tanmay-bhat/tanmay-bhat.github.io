  Microsoft is offering fundamentals exam vouchers for those who attend and complete their virtual training. You can take a look at upcoming events and register by going to [Microsoft Events](https://events.microsoft.com).

  Then you can register for the training of an exam of your choice by searching it in the page.   
  
  
  So far I have seen that Microsoft offers free exam vouchers for all fundamentals exam i.e. 

  1. [Azure Data Fundamentals](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/azure-data-fundamentals/)

  2. [Azure Fundamentals](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/azure-fundamentals/#certification-exams) 

  3. [Azure AI fundamentals](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/azure-ai-fundamentals/).   
  
  
  Once you register the training and attend it, you can go to that certification website, schedule it through Pearson VUE. &nbsp;

  If the email used to register for the event is the same as the MSA (Microsoft Account) email used for certification, You should see a banner to claim 100% free voucher, click *claim *to get that, like below.

  Then, you can schedule the exam at your day of choice from home and get certified.
